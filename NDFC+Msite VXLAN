Introduction
This document describes how to configure Nexus 9000v VXLAN EVPN Multisite deployment with NDFC.


Prerequisites
Requirements

Cisco recommends that you have knowledge of these topics:
    NDFC
    Multi-Site VXLAN EVPN
    CML simulator

Components Used
CML 2.8
Virtual Nexus Dashboard 3.2.2f
NDFC 12.2.3
N9000v 10.5(3f)


Configure
Network Diagram

High Level Steps
1. Create 3 Fabrics (2 "Data Center VXLAN EVPN" + 1 "Mutli-Site External Network")
2. Create MSD and move previous 3 fabrics into MSD
3. Create external Fabric
4. Create VRF/Network and attach them to Leaf switches.


Configurations
1/ Connect Nexus9000v OOB to NDFC
    CML and NDFC are installed on same esxi host.
    CML external connecter "OOB-Bridge" bridge to Nexus Dashboard Management vmnic.
    Connect all Nexus9000v mgmt ports and "OOB-Bridge" to OOB Switch.

2/ Create 2 "Data Center VXLAN EVPN" fabric on NDFC
2.1 Define "Fabric Name" & "Fabric Type" and fill in "Genernal Parameters" such as BGP AS number,Fabric Interface Numbering, Underlay Protocol and Anycast Gateway MAC


Fabric interface are links connected between leaf and spine switches.

Underlay Routing Protocol is used to setup leaf-spine connectivity.

Anycast Gateway MAC address is the server default gateway mac address.

2.2 Define Reolication 

Replication Mode for BUM traffic, we can use Multicast or Ingress Replication.

Chose Spine RR size


2.3 Define Underlay Protocols

Define 2 loopback ports, one for underlay routing protocol and another for VTEP source.


2.4 Define Resources

 

Underlay Routing Loopback IP Range: Used to underlay neighbor setup.

Underlay VTEP loopback IP Range: Used to setup nve peers.

Layer 2 VXLAN VNI Range: These are the VNIDs which  mapped to Vlans

Layer 3 VXLAN VNI Range: These are the Layer 3 VNIDs that mapped to layer 3 VNI Vlan to nn-segment


2.5 Add Switch and Change Switch Role

Change switch role and "Recalculate and Deploy"


2.6 Change interface access policy

We are using CSR1000v connect to Server Leaf, so configure e1/3 as access port.


2.7 Refer previous steps create Site-2.


3/ Create ISN Fabric
3.1 Create new fabric type "Multi-Site External Network" 

3.2 Change ISN role to "Core Router"


3.3 Create Loopback0 on both ISN nodes.

Create loopback 0 per ISN device, used for "Centralized_To_Route_Server" server list.

ISN1 172.31.0.1/32

ISN2 172.31.0.2/32

 
4/ Create VXLAN EVPN Multi-Site fabric "MSD"
4.1 Create new fabric type "VXLAN EVPN Multi-Site"

4.2 Define DCI Type


"Multi-Site Overlay IFC Deplioyment Method" contain 3 method:

1. "Manual": Requires explicit creation and management of overlay IFCs between border gateways or route servers.

2. "Direct_To_BGWS": Useful for straightforward topologies where BGWs connect directly to each other.

3. "Centralized_To_Route_Server": BGWs form overlay BGP connections to the route server(s), which act as a central point for inter-site routing.


4.3 Define msite resource

4.4 Move Site-1&Site-2&ISN into MSD

4.5 Create multisite underlay links

Edit other links between BGW and ISN.


4.6 Recalculate and Deploy


5/ Create VRF
5.1 Create VRF

5.2 Attach VRF to Leafs and BGWs

5.3 Create Network

5.4 Attach Networks to Server Leaf

Attach vlan 2300 to Site1&Site2 Leaf1 e1/3. Same steps attach vlan 2301 to Site1&Site2 Leaf2 e1/3


5.5 Attach Networks to BGWs

6/ Final Topology
